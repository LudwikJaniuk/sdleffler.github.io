Hello! I'm a hobbyist programmer and a student violinist. I live in Berkeley, California, just a 15 minute walk from the UC Berkeley campus, although I don't go there. If you'd like to stop by and chat about Rust, programming, type theory (be warned -- I don't know much!) or anything else, feel free to contact me.
