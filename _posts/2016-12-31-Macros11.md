title: Creating an enum iterator using Macros 1.1
---

Early today I was thinking about some testing strategies for a little project I'm working on.  One idea I had was to test the output of of a function when applied to every possible variant of an enum.  One way I could implement this was manually naming every variant of the enum in question -- probably while using a macro.  However, I am terrible at keeping track of things, and I would most likely add a new variant to my enum without updating my tests.  Certainly I could include in the macro a line of code that matched each variant like this:

```rust
match Test::A {
    Test::A => (),
    Test::B => (),
}
```
This would certainly enforce the compiler to remind me to update my tests whenever I update my enum, but what I really wanted to do is learn Macros 1.1.  So let's do that instead.  Here, I will describe my story of learning Macros 1.1.

So the first thing we need to do is start a new crate for our project.

```bash
> cargo new --bin hello-world
```

## Hello World

Let's start with a hello world project.  All I want is to be able to call `hello_world()` on a derived type.  I just want to be able to do this:

```rust
#[derive(HelloWorld)]
struct Pancakes;

fn main() {
    Pancakes::hello_world();
}
```

With some kind of nice output, like ```Hello, World! My name is Pancakes.```.  So let's do that first.  So let's find some resources.  The best information about Macros 1.1 has come from dtolney, from his [slides](https://github.com/dtolnay/talks/tree/master/2016.12-macros1.1-syn-quote) and from his [video presentation](https://air.mozilla.org/rust-meetup-december-2016-12-15/) (if you haven't seen this Rust Meetup, I highly recommend it; it's fantastic).

The first thing I need to do is crate a new project.

```bash
> cargo new --bin hello-world
```

Let's go ahead and write up what we think our macro will look like from a user perspective.  In `hello-world\main.rs` we write:

``` rust
#![feature(proc_macro)] // Promised to not be required coming Rust 1.15!
#[macro_use]
extern crate hello_world_macro;

#[derive(HelloWorld)]
struct FrenchToast;

#[derive(HelloWorld)]
struct Waffles;

fn main() {
    FrenchToast::hello_world();
    Waffles::hello_world();
}
```

Great.  So now we just need to actually write up this procedural macro.  Let's start a new crate called `hello-world-macro` inside our `hello-world` project.

```bash
hello-world\ > cargo new hello-world-macro
```

To make sure that our `hello-world` crate is able to find this new crate we've crated, we'll add it to our toml:

``` toml
[dependencies]
hello-world-macro = { path = "hello-world-macro" }
```

As for our `hello-world-macro` crate, we will just copy and paste some boilerplate found in dtolney's slides:

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro, proc_macro_lib)]
extern crate proc_macro;
extern crate syn;
#[macro_use] extern crate quote;

use proc_macro::TokenStream;

#[proc_macro_derive(HelloWorld)]
pub fn hello_world(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    // Construct a string representation of the type definition
    let s = input.to_string();
    
    // Parse the string representation
    let ast = syn::parse_macro_input(&s).unwrap();

    // Build the impl
    let gen = impl_hello_world(&ast);
    
    // Return the generated impl
    gen.parse().unwrap()
}
```

So there is a lot going on here.  First we have introduced two new crates: `syn` and `quote`.  As you may have noticed, `TokenSteam` is only used to be converted into a string.  This string is supposed to a string of the rust code for which we are deriving `HelloWorld` for.  That's it.  So what we really need is to be able to _parse_ rust code into something we can use.  This is where `syn` comes to play.  `syn` is a `nom` based rust parser, and it's really really cool.  The other crate we've introduced is `quote`.  Let's wait until we get to the next part before we talk about this, but essentially it's the dual of `syn` and will make serializing rust code really, really easy.

These comments seem to give you our general strategy.  We are going to take a string represtation of the rust code we are deriving for, we will parse it using `syn`, we will construct the implementation of our hello world (using `quote`) then we will pass it back to rust compiler.

Great, so let's implement `impl_hello_world(&ast)`.

``` rust
fn impl_hello_world(ast: &syn::MacroInput) -> quote::Tokens {
    let name = &ast.ident;
    quote! {
        impl #name {
            fn hello_world(&self) {
                println!("Hello, World! My name is {}", stringify!(#name));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

So this is where quotes comes in.  The `ast` argument is a structure that gives us a representation of the declaration of our type (either a `struct` or an `enum`).  Check out the [docs](https://docs.rs/syn/0.10.5/syn/struct.MacroInput.html), there is some useful information here.  We are able to get the name of the type using `ast.ident`.  The `quote!` macro then let's us write up the rust code that we wish to return and convert it to somethat it can convert to a `TokenStream` and let's us use some really cool templating magic; we simply just write `#name` and `quote!` will replace it with the variable named `name`.  You can even do some repition similar to regular macros work.  It's really cool, and you should check out the [docs](https://docs.rs/quote) for a good introduction.

So I think that's it.  Oh well we do need to add dependencies for `syn` and `quote` in the `cargo.toml` for `hello-world-macro`.

```toml
[dependencies]
syn = "0.10.5"
quote = "0.3.10"
```

That should be it.  Let's try to compile `hello-world`.

```bash
error: the `#[proc_macro_derive]` attribute is only usable with crates of the `proc-macro` crate type
 --> hello-world-macro\src\lib.rs:8:3
  |
8 | #[proc_macro_derive(HelloWorld)]
  |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Oh, so it appears tat we need to declare that our `hello-world-macro` crate is a `proc-macro` crate type.  How do we do this?  Well, we just go find a proc macro crate on github and see what they did to their `cargo.toml` of course.  It turns out we need to add this to our toml:

```toml
[lib]
proc-macro = true
```

Ok so now, let's compile `hello-world`.  Executing `cargo run` now yields:

```bash
Hello, World! My name is FrenchToast
Hello, World! My name is Waffles
```

That's it! We've created our first custom derive using `syn` and `quote` and it was actually quite easy.  Now let's try to create something less trivial.

## EnumIterator

So let's follow the same strategy as we did before by creating a new crate and writing out how we think this enum iterator should work.

```rust
#![feature(proc_macro)]
#[macro_use] extern crate enum_iter;

#[derive(Debug, EnumIterator)]
pub enum Test {
    A,
    B,
    C(u32,u32),
    D { a: String, b: bool },
}

fn main() {
    for variant in Test::enum_iter() {
        println!("{:?}", variant);
    }
}
```

What I'd really like to see from this

```
A
B
C(0, 0)
D { a: "", b: false }
```

Let's just go ahead and copy and paste the boilerplate we from our previous discussion and make some minor modifications:

``` rust
#![feature(proc_macro, proc_macro_lib)]
extern crate proc_macro;
extern crate syn;
#[macro_use]
extern crate quote;

use syn::{ Ident, Body, Variant, VariantData };
use proc_macro::TokenStream;

#[proc_macro_derive(EnumIterator)]
pub fn enum_iterator(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    let s = input.to_string();
    let ast = syn::parse_macro_input(&s).unwrap();

    let name = &ast.ident;
    let gen = match ast.body {
        Body::Enum(ref variants) => impl_enum_iter(name, variants),
        Body::Struct(_) =>
            quote! {
                impl EnumIteratorOnlyWorksForIteratorsNotStructs for #name { }
            },
    };
    gen.parse().unwrap()
}

fn impl_enum_iter(name: &Ident, variants: &[Variant]) -> quote::Tokens {
    unimplemented!()
}
```

The first thing I need from `syn` are the variants of the enum.  But it is entirely possible that the type someone `#[derive(EnumIterator)]` for a struct, and we don't want that.  So we just try to implement a trait that I don't believe the user has defined to communicate this error -- this is probably not the recommended way to go about it, but this is what I did.  Let's try it out.  Let's go back to our main crate and test it with `#[derive(EnumIterator)] struct IterateMePlease;`.  Doing this will give us an error:

```bash
error[E0405]: unresolved trait `EnumIteratorOnlyWorksForIteratorsNotStructs`
```

Perfect, so now that we have done our due diligence let's continue.  So far `syn` has given us the ident and a vector of `Variant`s for our enum.  It's at this point where we need to sit down and think about what we want the generated.  Luckily for us, we have `quote!` and we can just write out what the generate code should look like.

```rust
fn impl_enum_iter(name: &Ident, variants: &[Variant]) -> quote::Tokens {
    let interface = quote::Ident::from(format!("_EnumIterator{}", name));
    let match_usize = match_usize(&name, variants);
    let size = variants.len();

    quote! {
        #[derive(Debug, Default)]
        pub struct #interface {
            count: usize,
        }

        impl #name {
            fn enum_iter() -> #interface {
                #interface::default()
            }
        }

        impl #interface {
            fn from_usize(n: usize) -> #name {
                match n {
                    #(#match_usize)*
                    _ => unreachable!(), // I think
                }
            }
        }

        impl ::std::iter::Iterator for #interface {
            type Item = #name;
            fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
                if self.count >= #size { return None }
                let result = #interface::from_usize(self.count);
                self.count += 1;
                Some(result)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

What I really want is to create a new type implementing `Iterator`.  I don't want this name to conflict with any possible names the user has created so I will call it something like `_EnumIterator#name`.  Unforuntately, I don't think this works in the using the `quote!` _macro_, but no fear `quote` gives us a way to crate an `ident` from a string -- `quote::Ident::from(format!("_EnumIterator{}", name));`.  So we start by declaring our `_EnumIterator{}`, and implement a method on our enum `enum_iter()` which will build us one.  The iterator will simply keep track of the count and then convert this count to the corresponding variant of the enum.  This is what `from_usize` is for.  Basically, in our case, I want something like this.

```rust
fn from_usize(n: usize) -> Test {
    match n {
        0 => Test::A,
        1 => Test::B,
        _ => unreachable!(),
    }
}
```

We will need to fill in those branches with `#(#match_usize)*`.  After that, the iterator is quite easy to implement.  Match the current count with an enum variant, increment the count, and return that enum.  That seems straightforward.  So how do we create this `match_usize` thing.  Since this is repeating `#(#match_usize)*` we will need to return of vector of things that `quote!` returns.  What I need to return is a _default_ representation of each variant.  So if the variant is a tuple type like `Test::A(u32, u32)`, I need to yield `Test::A(0,0)`, and if it's a struct type like `Test::A { a: String, b: i32 }`, then I should yeild `Test::A { a: "", b: 0 }`.  Let's take a look at what the finished product looks like.

```rust
fn match_usize(name: &Ident, variants: &[Variant]) -> Vec<quote::Tokens> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();

    for (idx, variant) in variants.iter().enumerate() {
        let id = &variant.ident;
        let new = match variant.data {
            VariantData::Unit => quote! {
                    #idx => #name::#id,
                },

            VariantData::Tuple(ref fields) => {
                let types: Vec<_> = fields.iter().map(|f| &f.ty).collect();
                quote! {
                    #idx => #name::#id( #(#types::default(),)* ),
                }
            },

            VariantData::Struct(ref fields) => {
                let items: Vec<_> = fields.iter().map(|f| {
                    let ident = &f.ident;
                    let ty = &f.ty;

                    quote! {
                        #ident: #ty::default()
                    }
                }).collect();

                quote! {
                    #idx => #name::#id { #(#items,)*  },
                }
            }
        };
        result.push(new);
    }

    result
}
```

So basically, I am just iterating through the variants of the enum, trying to figure out how to write out a default representaiton, and pushing that into a vector for which I will return.  The unit types is the easiest one.  I just need to return `quote! { #idx => #name::#id }` where the `#id` is the name of the enum variant.  Let's look at the other branches:

```rust
    VariantData::Tuple(ref fields) => {
        let types: Vec<_> = fields.iter().map(|f| &f.ty).collect();
        quote! {
            #idx => #name::#id( #(#types::default(),)* ),
        }
    },
```

Here we have a tuple type, and `syn` is nice enough to give us the fields of the tuples.  All we need to do then is get the types for all of these fields so we can call `#types::default(),` on each of them for our return.  So basically for an enum variant that is of the form `Test::C(u32,u32)` we will return `   0usize => Test::C(u32::defualt(), u32::default()),`.  Neat.  Let's look at struct variants now.

``` rust
    VariantData::Struct(ref fields) => {
        let items: Vec<_> = fields.iter().map(|f| {
            let ident = &f.ident;
            let ty = &f.ty;

            quote! {
                #ident: #ty::default()
            }
        }).collect();

        quote! {
            #idx => #name::#id { #(#items,)*  },
        }
    }
```

So in struct variant, we need both the field name and the type of our fields.  We can collect these into a vector for `quote::Tokens` by iterating through fields and returing `quote! { #ident: #ty::default() }`.  Once we have that, we can chain them together using the familiar macro repetition pattern `{ #(#items,)* },`.  So if our variant was `Test::D { a: String, b: i32 }`, we should be returning `Test::D { a: String::default(), b: i32::default() }`.

And that's it; I think.  So let's test it out.  Compile our main crate and we get exactly what we expected.

```
A
B
C(0, 0)
D { a: "", b: false }
```

As you may have noticed, this macro should only work if each of the variants consists of things that implement `Default`.  Let's see what happends if one of our variants doesn't.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct NoDefault;

#[derive(Debug, EnumIterator)]
pub enum Test {
    A,
    B(NoDefault),
}
```

If we compile this we get the error

```bash
error: no associated item named `default` found for type `NoDefault` in the current scope
 --> src\main.rs:7:17
  |
7 | #[derive(Debug, EnumIterator)]
  |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
```

Beautiful.  Users will love this error message.
