title: Electric Violin Experimentation
published: false

I recently got my hands on a Jordan 7-string electric violin. It's a real
beauty - with seven strings, the top four are your standard violin strings
(starting from the top, E, A, D, and G) and then you get a viola's C string,
and finally F and B♭ strings. The lowest B♭ string is exactly one whole step
lower than a cello's C string. And, in fact, it has the tone of a cello for its
low ranges. No joke, it's like a cello, viola, and violin all wrapped into one
instrument.

So now that I have a 7-string violin, what am I going to do with it?
Experiment. I've had a hankering for hard rock and heavy metal for the past
couple years, and certain songs from certain bands (Blind Guardian, Axxis, Iced
Earth, and Kamelot, to name a few of my favorite groups) make me itch to play
them. I've got 16 years of classical violin training so I may as well put it to
use. I'm looking to get a band together but it's been hard finding people to
jam with.

I've got my general genre locked down, so now I want to find my tone. This is
where I am now: scoping out various guitar pedals and soon amps in order to
figure out how to really screw up the sound of my violin. There are a few
obvious choices for pedals and then I've got a massive gap in my knowledge of
what goes well with what, really. Here's what I've got so far that I
*definitely* want on my pedalboard:

* Clean boost/overdrive, distortion if the boost/drive isn't enough. I've got a
  Dead Horse coming. Should be around in six weeks or so.
* Wah. I borrowed a Vox wah pedal from a friend and it sounds absolutely
  fantastic on my violin. When not sweeping the pedal, I can put my heel back,
  and get a muted, tamed sound, with a justified sort of calm-before-the-storm
  feel; press forward, and any of my seven strings will scream bloody murder
  out of the amp.
* Volume. An obvious choice; as a violinist I'm used to having massive control
  over my dynamics but with an electric I just don't have *any* control
  anymore. None at all. To me, this is the most alien part of playing an
  electric instrument.
* Looper. I need this for practice. If I ever play by myself, I can put down
  some chops with this and then improvise to 'em. That's a little more jazz
  than I'm into, but I'm probably going to take some jazz improv classes so why
  not?
* Tuner. I'm a classically trained violinist with perfect pitch but I've read
  and heard from accomplished rock/metal violinists that our particular sort of
  tuning takes a little more time than is appropriate onstage. It's also harder
  to tune when you're loud and onstage. So, for any gigging, a tuner pedal is
  necessary. The Jordan also shouldn't go out of tune very often; it has
  guitar-style tuners instead of the standard violin peg/fine-tuner
  arrangement.

These are no-brainers. Now I have to move on to the effects I'm not sure about.
As a violinist, I don't need vibrato or tremolo; I'm a violinist. We *invented*
vibrato and tremolo. Here's a list of effects which interest me:

* Chorus. In my understanding, chorus effects are deadly on a violin. If you
  want to stand out from a background, stomping on a chorus pedal will get you
  there.
* Reverb. Always fun. Bit of a lesser priority for me though, really.
* Delay. Great with pizzicato.
* Compression. I'm in the market for a bit of sustain, and specifically I want
  to see if there's a way to get some heavy-duty sustain on my pizz. It's
  unlikely I'll be able to get there without doing something crazy like putting
  thimbles on my fingers (which I'm tempted to try) but a compression pedal
  would probably be a part of that.

Last but not least, here are some effects I'm iffy on, but think could have
some merit:

* Phasing/flanging. I'm _really_ unsure about how these sound on a violin but I
  love the sound on a guitar, so it's probably worth a try.
* Octave/interval effects. I can play octaves myself. The only reason I'd want
  one of these would be if I'm trying to do something so crazy I can't finger
  it. In addition, digital shifting effects I've messed with like the octave
  up/down effects in Reaper and Audacity simply don't cut it for violin sounds,
  and get really wonky when shifting further than just a few half steps. I
  don't know if an octave pedal would do the same.

And finally, I need some sort of amp. I frankly have no idea what sort of an
amp I need. Going to be keeping an eye out here, but I'll probably end up
building my own, most likely from a kit. I'll also build myself whatever pedals
I can instead of buying them.

If you've got any ideas, suggestions, experience with playing an electric
violin through effects pedals, and/or experience with playing an extended range
violin, I'd be absolutely delighted to get some input and feedback on what I've
written above; my contact info can be found at the bottom of this page.

I'll soon be streaming myself playing and figuring this all out on Twitch -
once I set it up, you'll be able to find my channel
